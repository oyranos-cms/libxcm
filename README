libXcm:

    The libXcm library contains the a reference implementation of the 
    X Color Management specification. The X Color Management specification 
    allows to attach colour regions to X windows to communicate with colour
    servers.

    The XcmDDC API can be used to fetch a EDID data block from a monitor over
    a i2c communication. On Linux typical the i2c-dev module
    must be loaded to use this hardware data channel. The device nodes
    should obtain rights accessible to normal users. The package config info is
    in xcm-ddc.

    The XcmEdidParse API is for parsing EDID data blocks. A small example 
    application is included. The package config info is in xcm-edid.

    The XcmEvents API allowes to easily observe X11 colour management events.
    The included xcmsevents makes use of the XcmEvents API. The package config
    info is in xcm-x11.
