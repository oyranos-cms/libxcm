    net-color spec
   ================

The net-color spec defines a protocol which can be used by X11 clients to
offload color correction and transformation into the compositing manager. The
basic idea is to let X11 clients define regions and attach ICC profiles to them
and then let the compositing manager do the color transformation.


   Color Profile
  ---------------

A color profile is described by the following C structure:

typedef struct {
	uuid_t uuid;      /* UUID of the profile			*/
	uint32_t size;    /* number of bytes following			*/
} XColorProfile;

It defines a single ICC profile that can be uploaded to the compositing manager
and later referenced in color regions. The actual profile data follows directly
after the structure.


   Color Region
  --------------

A color region is described by the following C structure:

typedef struct {
	uint32_t region;  /* XserverRegion				*/
	uuid_t uuid;      /* UUID of the associated profile		*/
} XColorRegion;

It defines a region and the attached color profile. Color regions are attached
to windows and used by the compositing manager to apply the proper color
transformation. Windows can have an unlimited amount of regions attached, though
only the first 2 * 2^32 can be referenced.


   Atoms

 _NET_COLOR_PROFILES:

Is used to upload color profiles to the compositing manager. Clients attach a
a list of one or more XColorProfile to the root window. Compositing manager then
fetches the list and saves the profiles in an internal database and deletes the
property.
TODO: Allow to delete profiles from the compositing manager.

 _NET_COLOR_TARGET:

Is attached to windows and specifies on which XRandR output the window should
look correctly. The compositing manager uses the output's _ICC_PROFILE property
to fetch the output device ICC profile and creates the appropriate device links.
TODO: Automatic targes selection based on where the window is positioned.

 _NET_COLOR_MANAGEMENT:

Is a type of ClientMessage that the clients send to the root window. It is used
to enable or disable the color management. By default the compositing manager
does no color management. Clients need to enable it explicitely.
TODO: Details of the ClientMessage format.
